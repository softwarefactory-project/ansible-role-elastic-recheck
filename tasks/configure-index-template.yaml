# NOTE: After a while, there was too many shards in the OpenSearch, but
# most of them was "UNASSIGNED". It means, that it was waiting for another
# node to start the replicas. In our case, there would be no additional node,
# so it will fail, but the shards will be "waiting".
# To check UNASSIGNED charts:
#   curl --user admin:$PASSWORD  https://$(hostname)/opensearch/_cat/shards | grep UNASSIGNED
#
# To delete shards:
#   curl --user admin:$PASSWORD  https://$(hostname)/opensearch/_cat/shards | \
#     grep UNASSIGNED | \
#     grep <DATE> | \
#     awk {'print $1'}  |  \
#     xargs -i curl -XDELETE --user admin:$PASSWORD  "https://$(hostname)/opensearch/{}"
